This project utilizes the ESP32 as an Access Point to host a web dashboard that displays real-time temperature and humidity readings from a DHT22 sensor. If humidity goes below 30% or above 70%, the ESP32 turns on a red LED and shows a corresponding alert on the dashboard. The data updates every 2 seconds without page refresh
